	- Added a space to the translation table in phrtsd.
	- Cosmetic changes to bring this module into line with other
	  Perl modules: added test.pl, Changes, MANIFEST, README;
	  corrected some spelling, used "make dist", and so on.

	- In com.c and randlib.c, changed the Fortran-style labels
	  and goto's in certain functions to proper {} blocks.  (For
	  this I consulted the original L'Ecuyer/Cote paper.)
	- Changed all floats to doubles.
	- Increased the precision of many literals in accordance with
	  the original papers (e.g. 1/M1 in ranf, log 4 in genbet,
	  and so on).
	- Corrected one test in test.pl.

0.63  Wed Sep  5 09:32:55 2001
	- Changed internal variables in wrapper.c to the new names:
	  na became PL_na; sv_yes, PL_sv_yes.
